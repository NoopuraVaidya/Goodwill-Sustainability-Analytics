# Sustainability Analytics Framework for Goodwill

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Sustainability Analytics Framework** for Goodwill, aimed at tracking donations, measuring environmental impact, and forecasting sustainability outcomes. The analysis emphasizes how donations contribute to **CO₂ emission reduction, landfill diversion, and sustainable operations**.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
- Donation and store sustainability data were obtained from Goodwill records.
- Key variables included donation volumes, item categories, and environmental factors such as CO₂ emissions saved and landfill diversion rates.

### 2. Data Preparation
- Cleaned missing and inconsistent records.
- Standardized formats for dates, store IDs, and donation categories.
- Aggregated store-level metrics to generate sustainability KPIs.

### 3. Metrics Defined
- **CO₂ Emissions Saved** – Estimated based on item category and material lifecycle.
- **Landfill Diversion** – Volume of items prevented from entering landfills.
- **Donation Volume Trends** – Time-series analysis of donations by store.

### 4. Dashboard Development
- **Tableau** was used to create interactive dashboards:
  - [Donation Insights Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/noopura.vaidya/viz/DonationInsights_GoodwillStores/DONATIONINSIGHTSSUSTAINABILITYDASHBOARD)
  - [Environmental Impact Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/noopura.vaidya/viz/Environmentalmpact_GoodwillStores/Dashboard1)

### 5. Machine Learning Exploration
- Conducted experiments in **IBM SPSS Modeler** to explore:
  - Predictive modeling of donation volumes.
  - Identifying sustainability drivers at store-level.
- Code files are not included, but the approach is documented in the final report.

## Business Impact
- Provides Goodwill with **data-driven insights** into sustainability.
- Supports **resource allocation and operational efficiency**.
- Demonstrates environmental stewardship to stakeholders.
